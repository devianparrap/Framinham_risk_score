# Framimgham Risk Score Estimation

"De Todo Corazón" is a interdisciplinary intervention program held by one of the largest health insurers in Colombia aimed at
minimizing the risk of adverse events like stroke, myiocardial infraction and hearth faillure associated to cardiovascular 
and renal risk factors. In the adjunted code I estimate the Framingahm Risk Score to categorize patients in three different 
categories to assess the risk of an adverse events in the following 30 years based in the article of D´Agostino et al published
in [Circulation](Circulation. 2008 Feb 12;117(6):743-53 doi: 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.107.699579). I used a longituidinal database 
of medical claims to obtain the requiered parmeters for the equation by selecting the latest measure of each clinical  varible per 
patient in 2018.
